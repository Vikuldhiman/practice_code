        <h3>1. The Taj Mahal, Agra</h3>
        <img src="image/taj-mahal.jpg" alt="">
        <p>The Taj Mahal, Agra</p>
        <p>Perhaps India's most recognizable building, the Taj Mahal is also the world's most famous testimony to the power of love. Named after Mumtaz Mahal, the favorite wife of Emperor Shah Jahan, this most beautiful of mausoleums was begun upon her death in 1631 and took 20,000 workmen until 1648 to complete.

            Incorporating many elements of Islamic design including arches, minarets, an onion-shaped dome, and black calligraphy inlaid around the entrance, the Taj Mahal is largely constructed of white marble. Adding to its splendor are delicate inlaid floral patterns and precious and semi-precious stones such as jade, lapis lazuli, diamonds, and mother of pearl.
            
            The best time to visit is either at dawn or dusk when the atmosphere is brilliantly altered by the change in lighting. If possible, try to catch a view of the Taj Mahal's reflection from the far bank of the Yamuna River-it makes for a memorable (and safe) selfie.</p>

            <h3>2. The Holy City of Varanasi</h3>
            <img src="image/varanasi.jpg" alt="">
            <p>The Holy City of Varanasi</p>
            <p>Dating back to the 8th century BC, Varanasi is one of the oldest still inhabited cities in the world. A major pilgrimage center for Hindus, this holy city has long been associated with the mighty Ganges River, one of the faith's most important religious symbols.

                Varanasi offers many reasons to visit, not least of them the chance to explore the Old Quarter adjacent to the Ganges where you'll find the Kashi Vishwanath Temple, built in 1780. The New Vishwanath Temple with its seven separate temples is also of interest.
                
                Bathing in the Ganges is of great importance to Hindus, and numerous locations known as "ghats" feature stairways leading to the water where the faithful bathe before prayers. The largest are Dasashvamedh Ghat and Assi Ghat. The latter, at the confluence of the Ganges and Asi rivers, is considered particularly holy.</p>

            <h3>3. Harmandir Sahib: The Golden Temple of Amritsar</h3>
            <img src="image/sahib.jpg" alt="">
            <p>Harmandir Sahib: The Golden Temple of Amritsar</p>
            <p>Founded in 1577 by Ram Das, Amritsar is an important hub of Sikh history and culture. The main attraction here is Harmandir Sahib, opened in 1604 and still often referred to as the Golden Temple for its beautiful gold decoration.

                The holiest of India's many Sikh shrines (it also attracts many Hindus and people of other faiths), the temple was built in a blend of Hindu and Islamic styles. Its lower marble section features such flourishes as ornate inlaid floral and animal motifs, while the large golden dome represents a lotus flower, a symbol of purity to Sikhs.
                
                In addition to its splendid design, visitors are equally impressed with the temple's spiritual atmosphere, an effect enhanced by the prayers continuously chanted from the Sikh holy book and broadcast throughout the complex.
                
                Part of the overall experience – and visitors are welcome to participate – is the chance to enjoy one of the 50,000 free meals the attraction serves up to visitors each and every day.</p>

            <h3>4. Mumbai: The Gateway of India</h3>
            <img src="image/india.jpg" alt="">
            <p>The Gateway of India, Mumbai</p>
            <p>Standing an impressive 26 meters tall and overlooking the Arabian Sea, the iconic Gateway of India is a must-see when in Mumbai. Built to commemorate the arrival of King George V and his wife Queen Mary in 1911, this stunning piece of architecture was opened with much pomp and ceremony in 1924 and was, for a while, the tallest structure in the city.

                Constructed entirely of yellow basalt and concrete and notable for its Indo-Saracenic design, the Gateway of India was also the scene of a rather less jubilant procession of British soldiers in 1948 when India gained its independence. These days, the huge archway provides a stunning backdrop that is as popular among locals as it is tourists.
                
                Hot Tip: After visiting the Gateway of India, pop over to the adjacent Taj Mahal Palace and Tower for a delectable High Tea, a fun thing to do in Mumbai since this lovely luxury hotel opened in 1903.</p>

            <h3>5. The Beaches of Goa</h3>
            <img src="image/goa.jpg" alt="">
            <p class="palm">Palm-lined beach in Goa</p>
            <p>Long known within India as the "go-to" destination for those seeking a great beach holiday, Goa's beautiful western coastline, overlooking the Arabian Sea, has only recently been discovered by tourists from overseas. Goa's more than 60 miles of coastline is home to some of the world's loveliest beaches, each with their own particular appeal.

                For those looking for peace and quiet, isolated Agonda Beach is a good choice, while Calangute Beach is by far the most commercial and crowded. For those in search of posh resorts, yoga getaways, and spa vacations, the beaches of Mandrem, Morjim, and Ashwem are fashionable among wealthy Indians and Westerners alike. Palolem is another one of Goa's popular beaches in a beautiful setting.
                
                While in Goa, be sure to visit the Bhagwan Mahavir Wildlife Sanctuary. This superb attraction is home to thick forests and plenty of fauna, including deer, monkeys, elephants, leopards, tigers, and black panthers, as well as India's famous king cobras, and some 200 species of birds.
                
                Also worth a visit is Divar Island, accessed by ferry from Old Goa. Highlights include Piedade, a typical Goan village and home to the Church of Our Lady of Compassion with its interesting stucco work, Baroque plaster decorations, and altars, as well as stunning views of the surrounding countryside.</p>
